        <p>Just like any regular bicycle, your electric bike is going to need a bit of routine maintenance. The electrical systems usually take care of themselves; but like all vehicles, t’s the tires, the brakes, and wheels that need a bit of TLC.</p><p>We'll ensure that before you buy, your bike is in tip-top shape from the moment you take it out of our store. This is especially important for ebikes, as they need to be set up correctly. To get the longest life possible out of your TycheBike, you can take some simple steps to maintain it yourself -- you can take it to an experienced dealer.</p>

        <p>The cities where bicycling is most successful as a legitimate mode of transportation are the ones who make bike infrastructure and resources available to as wide a portion of the public as possible. This goes beyond physical infrastructure -- successful biking requires multi-faceted community-wide effort to make it available to all.</p><p>Think women-friendly bike shops, affordable bike co-ops, bicycle route maps available in tourism offices, and a strong bike advocacy movement that represents the diversity of its community. Think bike lanes that are safe enough for a child to ride down unaccompanied, wide enough for a disability scooter to fit in, and reaching into the city’s low-income neighbourhoods as well as its business district.</p>

        <p>Cycling to work in the pouring rain is not as fun as cycling to work in mild, dry weather. Getting ready to ride through a snowstorm takes a bit more prep than hopping on your wheels in shorts and a t-shirt. But if climate mattered the most for biking, then LA would be the most bike-friendly city on the planet!</p><p>Vancouver gets so much rain that it's earned the nickname “Raincouver.” And yet, at 10%, it has one of the highest mode shares in North America, with a vibrant urban cycling scene even throughout the squelchiest weather.</p>

        <p>It's not just that Amsterdam and Copenhagen are flat! A lack of hills is helpful for a robust and diverse cycling community. And it absolutely helps for cargo biking and elderly cycling. But it's just one of many factors that can make or break a city's bikeability, and now eBikes are changing the game on topography.</p>
